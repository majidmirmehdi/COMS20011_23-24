## Teams:
* The Teams Team is [[COMS20011: Data-Driven Computer Science 2023/24]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a0DQ-4IeBWTiBTCNmPvAmkc-CjNXlKFBJHObtpLyHaVw1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=5928cfed-1e17-4d2b-a3a7-4ab403410857&tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b).  You should have access already through the "Teams" panel.  If not, please get in touch with the COMS Student Enquiries Mailbox at coms-student-enquiries@bristol.ac.uk

## Exam info:
* The course is assessed 100% by a multiple-choice exam.
* The exam will have 20 questions, worth 100 marks, and will be 2 hours. It does require a calculator (which must be non-programmable).
* If you have any questions regarding alternative exam arrangements, please get in touch with the COMS Student Enquiries Mailbox at coms-student-enquiries@bristol.ac.uk
* The exam is closed-book (so no additional materials are allowed). There will be a formulae sheet with the exam.


## Past exam papers:
| Year  | Paper | Questions to IGNORE! |
| ----- | ----- | -------------------- |
| 20/21 | [pdf](/Past_Exams/main_2021_answers.pdf) | 6,8,13,14|
| 21/22 | [pdf](/Past_Exams/main_2122_answers.pdf) | 5,7,10,17,19,20 |
| 22/23 | [pdf](/Past_Exams/main_2223_answers.pdf) | 2,3,8 |

Important notes:
* We rejigged the course content a bit last year, and also again this year, so some questions are no longer relevant.  These questions are in the "Questions to IGNORE!" column.
* The 20/21 exam was exceptionally short.
